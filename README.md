# AMD CodeXL Static Analyzer Command Line Tool #

This package includes the command line tool for processing:
* OpenCL kernels
* HLSL shaders
* OpenGL shaders

The tool compiles and analyzes a kernel/shader and can output:
* Any build errors
* Textual IL and ISA representation
* Static Analysis results
* Binary object

This tool is part of the AMD CodeXL tools suite. See the CodeXL User Guide [here](http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/codexl/) for documentation.

## System Requirements ##
